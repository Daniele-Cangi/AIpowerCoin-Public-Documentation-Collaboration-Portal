## Key Features

- **Stability anchored to energy:** Value comes from real European energy data, updated daily.
- **Transparency:** Every operation is attested and publicly verifiable.
- **Sustainability:** Only a prudent quota of energy is converted, preserving reserves.
- **Secure governance:** Attestations are digitally signed by multiple independent roles.
- **Auditability:** Anyone can check the data and verify signatures.

## How it works

1. Each day, the system collects real energy consumption data (ENTSO-E).
2. A fraction of this energy (commit ratio) is "covered" and converted into digital value.
3. A planner calculates the stability and suggests how much new value can be issued.
4. Everything is signed and published in a daily attestation file.
5. The dashboard displays the system status in a clear way.
